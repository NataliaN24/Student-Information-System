● This is a platform which contains the information of students in an institute for a degree.

● It supports up to 8 groups of students for the major. The data for each group are  kept in separate files (of the format group.txt).

● It makes it possible to enter the following student data:
○ Three names
○ Faculty number
○ Disciplines that the student studies (at least one and up to ten), along with the grade in each discipline.

● It unsubscribes a student (by faculty number) from a given group. The withdrawn student, is deleted from the file.

● Sorts the students of each group according to the user's choice - in ascending or descending order by:
○ Average success
○ Faculty number

● Saves the sorted list to the file for the given group.

● Displays the list of students of a given group on the screen

● Reads information about students from more than one group and displays it on the screen
sorted by faculty number or GPA.
